 agot_bm_8282_desc:0 "The Year of the False Spring has passed, and #italic winter is coming#! — and along with it, a spark that will ignite the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nRhaegar Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne, has kidnapped Lyanna Stark, daughter of the Warden of the North and betrothed to the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. When her brother Brandon Stark rode south demanding redress for her abduction, the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen denied him a fair hearing, brutally executing him alongside his father.\n\nBut when the Mad King called for the heads of the young Lords Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale instead raised his banners in rebellion. #bold As fighting spreads across Westeros like wildfire, it is up to you to decide the fate of the kingdom. For when you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.#!"

With the grisly deaths of his father and brother at the hands of the Mad King, Ned is now Lord of Winterfell — and fighting a war for his life.\n\n#bold Will Ned rescue his sister from Prince Rhaegar, or will he suffer the fate of his kin, joining the ashes beneath the dragon?#!"

As his father’s sanity has dwindled, Rhaegar finds himself caught in the web of suspicions. At the Tourney of Harrenhal, scandal shook the realm when Rhaegar crowned a daughter of the North his Queen of Love and Beauty, rather than his own wife. A year later, Rhaegar eloped with his beloved Lyanna, though some say he kidnapped her.\n\n#bold As the brutal actions of his father inflame the situation beyond the point of diplomacy, can the Dragon Prince save his house from oblivion?#!"

Hearing threats all around him — both real and unfounded — the Mad King has grown increasingly obsessed with fire.\n\n#bold As the Seven Kingdoms face a civil war, will Aerys cling loosely to power from the Iron Throne, or will he simply burn them all?#!"

Once the Hand — and a friend — to King Aerys, Tywin resigned and returned to Casterly Rock after one too many slights. Now, despite the Mad King’s call to arms, Tywin has carefully remained out of the war.\n\n#bold Will Tywin support his onetime friend and king, or can he spin this war to the benefit of his own house instead?#!"

With his betrothed kidnapped and his death ordered, Robert has no choice but to muster the Stormlands against the Mad King.\n\n#bold Bent on destroying the Targaryens, Robert will need all his might to succeed. But will his beloved Lyanna ever be his?#!"
