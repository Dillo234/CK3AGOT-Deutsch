 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.t:0 "Envoys of the Iron Bank"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.desc:0 "My servants bring me word that three envoys from the Iron Bank of Braavos have arrived seeking an audience with me. Intrigued, I agree to meet them.\n\nThe foreigners look out of place in my hall, their three-tiered hats and purple robes a stark contrast to my guards’ boiled leather. Their accent is difficult to understand, tinged with the colors of the east. Their proposal, however, is plain enough.\n\nThey offer a choice between three loans: one quite modest, one more significant, and a third for a sum that causes my eyebrow to twitch upward. Whatever I borrowed would have to be repaid with interest, of course."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.a:0 "Just a modest loan would do a world of good."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.a_tt:0 "Repayment in full, including interest, will be due in two years."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.b:0 "The mean between extremes is often best. I’ll take the middle loan."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.b_tt:0 "Repayment in full, including interest, will be due in two years."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.c:0 "Just imagine what I could accomplish with such a sum!"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.c_tt:0 "Repayment in full, including interest, will be due in eighteen months."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.d:0 "If I want something, I will save the gold myself. Best to avoid entanglements with bankers."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0001.d_tt:0 "Send the envoys away."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.t:0 "The Iron Bank’s Due"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.desc:0 "Two years almost to the day since they first set foot in my halls, the same three envoys of the Iron Bank of Braavos return. They begin with the niceties, the compliments on my land, my keep, the attentiveness of my servants, but I have no illusions as to their purpose. No sooner have the courtesies left their mouths than they get to the sharp point of their visit.\n\n\"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName], payment for the loan you took against the Iron Bank of Braavos has come due,\" the lead envoy says.\n\nThere is not a drop of incivility in his manner, yet a chill still runs down my spine."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.a:0 "A debt is a debt. Best to pay what is owed."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.a_tt:0 "You pay off the debt in full."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.b:0 "I cannot afford to pay at this time. Surely they’ll understand…"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.b_tt:0 "The envoys will return soon, after more interest has accrued."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.c:0 "I cannot afford to pay at this time. Surely they’ll understand…"

 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.d_tt:0 "The envoys will return soon, after more interest has accrued."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.e:0 "The arrogance of these coin-clutchers sickens me. Begone from here, worms!"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.e_tt:0 "You will default on your debt to the Iron Bank, a decision many kings and princes have come to rue."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.f:0 "I cannot afford the full amount. Let us work out a payment schedule."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0002.f_tt:0 "The envoys will allow you to pay the loan back over time."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.t:0 "The Iron Bank’s Due"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.desc:0 "I feel a slight shiver when a servant informs me that the envoys from the Iron Bank of Braavos have returned once more. I had thought to be rid of these people, but I find them yet again waiting for me in my audience chamber, stiff-necked and humorless. They are not disrespectful, but their niceties are somewhat diminished compared to their previous visit.\n\n\"Your debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos has increased,\" the lead envoy says. \"To avoid further accrual of interest, I must advise that you pay in full at once.\"\n\nHis voice is stony and cold, like the foreign land from whence he hails."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.a:0 "There is no sense in letting this debt get out of hand. I’ll pay."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.a_tt:0 "You pay the debt, and the Iron Bank considers the matter closed."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.b:0 "I know it sounds bad, but I don’t have the money just at the moment…"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.b_tt:0 "The patience of the Iron Bank is not limitless. They will be back."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.c:0 "I know it sounds bad, but I don’t have the money just at the moment…"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.c_tt:0 "The patience of the Iron Bank is not limitless. They will be back."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.d:0 "I know it sounds bad, but I don’t have the money just at the moment…"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.d_tt:0 "The patience of the Iron Bank is not limitless. They will be back."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.e:0 "I cannot abide the greed of these parasites. They’ll get not repayment from me."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0003.e_tt:0 "You will default on your debt to the Iron Bank, a decision many kings and princes have come to rue."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.t:0 "The Iron Bank’s Due"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.desc:0 "I step into Grand Hall, and my stomach drops into a void. The accursed Braavosi bankers are back yet again! In the name of all Gods, Old and New, how can I be rid of these vultures!?\n\n\"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName], I come to inform you that the keyholders of the Iron Bank of Braavos have reached the end of their patience. You will pay your debt in full or elsewise face the consequences.\"\n\nI demand to know where he finds the nerve to threaten a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] in [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] own hall. His answer is characteristically steely.\n\n\"We honor our agreements and expect our clients to do likewise. You would do well to remember, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]: the Iron Bank will have its due. Always.\""
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.a:0 "Very well, I’ll pay. I’d rather not face the consequences of default."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.a_tt:0 "A most prudent choice."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.b:0 "You’re not going to believe this, but I really don’t have the money…"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.b_tt:0 "You will be considered in default."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.c:0 "You’re not going to believe this, but I really don’t have the money…"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.c_tt:0 "You will be considered in default."

 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.d_tt:0 "You will be considered in default."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0004.e:0 "I have listened to enough threats. Begone from me or I’ll have your heads!"

 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0005.desc:0 "My maester brings me a letter written on crisp parchment bearing the seal of the Iron Bank of Braavos. Frowning, I break the seal and read, my consternation growing line by line. It seems the Iron Bank will no longer seek repayment from me but instead will resort to less conventional and, I must confess, altogether less pleasant means of claiming its due."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0005.a:0 "They’re sponsoring a challenger to my title! War is inevitable!"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0005.b:0 "They’re undermining the finances of my realm! They want me impoverished!"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0005.c:0 "They’re taking over local business interests in an effort to ruin me!"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0006.t:0 "The Iron Bank’s Due"
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0006.desc:0 "The Iron Bank is firm in its demands on its clients but not unreasonable. They are, after all, a business, and businesses want nothing more than to run smoothly. To that end, the envoys offer to allow me to pay off my debt over four years in smaller increments."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0006.alt:0 "The Iron Bank of Braavos comes calling for its annual fee once again. The day I pay them off once and for all will be a most joyous occasion."
 agot_braavos_iron_bank.0006.a:0 "Take your coins and go."
