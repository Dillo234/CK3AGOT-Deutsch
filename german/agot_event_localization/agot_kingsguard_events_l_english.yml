Just today [child.GetSheHe] came before me and asked to set aside any betrothals I might have planned for [child.GetHerHim] so that [child.GetSheHe] can start training to become a member of [king.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [king.Custom('KingsguardName')]."

The [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] of the court seek to emulate [gallant_kingsguard.GetHerHis] deeds, and the [gallant_kingsguard.Custom('AttractionWomanManMultiple')] of the court compete for [gallant_kingsguard.GetHerHis] attention.

The child is trampled beneath the stomping heel of your [ROOT.Char.Custom('KingsguardName')], who crashes through [obstructing_brat.GetHerHim] with little more than a casual glance, affording the child the same attention as if [marching_kingsguard.GetSheHe] had stepped in a puddle.\n\nMashed by the boot, [obstructing_brat.GetName] now lays on the courtroom floor, moaning in pain, and [marching_kingsguard.GetName] marches [marching_kingsguard.GetHerHis] way to your side to being the morning's watch."
