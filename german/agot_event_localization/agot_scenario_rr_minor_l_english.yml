 agot_events_rr_minor.0001.desc.a:0 "I rose from my tent to put my armor on early this morning; the air was thick with cold humidity cut to the bone. The morning dew clung to the rubies on my breastplate, making them glimmer ever brighter, and across the horizon was the camp of the would-be usurper, smoke billowing up from between the tents, his tent in the centre of the rabble. So close, yet so far.\n\nMore than just the cold in my bones, I feel him, his anger, and I know that we will meet in this battle, that sword and warhammer will clash. The thought made my stomach sink for just a second. One of my manservants asked if something was wrong with me, and I laughed for a second before regaining my composure. “No, my friend, nothing is wrong,” I said.\n\n”Today is not the day I die.”"
 agot_events_rr_minor.0001.desc.b:0 "The air feels brisk and invigorating this morning as I look across the horizon and see that haughty dragon bastard’s tent billowing in the wind, smoke blowing across the lands between our two camps where the battle will soon ensue. I know it in my heart that I’ll track the proud prince down in the midst of the clamour and drive my hammer into his skull. It’s all been building to this; every battle, every skirmish, every dead knight has brought us to this point. It’s time to make Rhaegar bleed."

We could stay, perhaps mount a defence, perhaps even parlay with the Usurper to keep Dragonstone for our house. Whether or not our negotiations might be heard, or a defence might be worth it, is a question that hangs heavily over me… It would seem that the best option for what remains of us, and those loyal to us, would be to flee to the Free Cities and rebuild our power in exile."

 agot_events_rr_minor.0005.desc:0 "Despite the deafening hail of the thunderstorm violently pummeling the roofing of Dragonstone, Rhaella’s screams still seem to make their way to the surface of all the noise. Her labors, like the storm, have dragged on far longer than the norm – and much like what is left of the Targaryen fleet, Rhaella is faring poorly. Her ladies scurry in and out of the room with blood-soaked sheets and hands, and the Maester can do little but pray as she writhes about in her childbed.\n\nAt the same time that an ear-shattering thunder claps from what seems to be directly above the Castle, Rhaella unleashes a blood-curdling scream that is unmatched by her earlier cries. By the grace of the gods, the thunder and wind and hail stop long enough for all to hear it – the cries of a newborn baby.\n\nFor the first time in what has been days, Rhaella gives a relieved laugh, holding her newborn in her trembling arms, her sickly and blood-drained face smiling at her child. After all she has been through, this is a singular and brief reprieve from the horrors she has and is yet to face. “Stormborn,” she coos quietly, her voice unsteady as the maester takes the child away to be seen to. \n\nAnother clap of thunder accompanies a pained groan from Rhaella – the babe has come, but she still bleeds at an alarming rate. As those at the docks accept the possibility that the fleet may be no more come morning, those at her bedside do the same for Rhaella. Born of fire and blood, born amongst lightning and thunder, what purpose have the gods set for a child with such beginnings?"

 agot_events_rr_minor.0006.desc.a:0 "Though her labors were long and drawn out, Rhaella’s death was thankfully somewhat quick once she bore the child, death coming for her in the childbed before the warring world outside could add more to her agony. All that survives of her once powerful dynasty are her two children. \n\nThough they may be small, they are nonetheless Targaryens, and as long as there is a memory of the Mad King, these children will be hunted -- and there will surely be a grand reward waiting for whoever hands them over to the Iron Throne. \n\nWith time working against them, there’s little option left for their survival than to smuggle the two out of Dragonstone and across the sea to the Free Cities. Perhaps there, time and space will allow those still loyal to regroup, or perhaps, at least, the children’s names will fade away into obscurity as they grow. Perhaps they will know peace."
 agot_events_rr_minor.0006.desc.b:0 "I am unsure if it was the prayers of others, the fire of the dragon that burns in my blood, or just pure spite that saved me – but by some great miracle, the childbed has not become my deathbed. There is little rest to be had, however. Nowhere in Westeros will be safe for them, claim or not. \n\nI could flee across the sea with the children to the Free Cities, giving us time to recover and regroup. However, it is easier to hide two children than it is a former Queen – staying in Dragonstone may afford the children more discretion. If I can hold out, Dragonstone may prove politically beneficial to the children when they come of age. \n\nWhatever decision I make, it needs to be made soon. I have not a doubt in my mind that all of Westeros is after my children, seeking revenge, glory, or whatever coin the Iron Throne is offering up as some kind of sick bounty."

Rhaenys, and... \n\nTywin reaches out, gesturing for Robert to stop as his hand moves to uncover the second bundle. “Aegon Targaryen,” Tywin announces. “I would recommend saving yourself the discomfort, My Lord. There’s little left to see.” Robert hesitates for a moment, but ultimately decides it’s in his best interests to see for himself – something he immediately regrets when he lifts the cloak and is greeted by a faceless horror of bone and gore.

I have done my duty in defeating the Targaryens, but Jon Arryn now has a far greater task ahead of him."

Aerys' madness has only worsened, and his rule has become more tyrannical by the day;\n\nIn contrast, Robert Baratheon has proven to be a capable warrior as the rebels' leader, with a great question about his ability to rule. \n\nThe idea of betraying Aerys is risky yet tempting, but waiting, at least now, may be the best option as the sides may turn one way or another."
