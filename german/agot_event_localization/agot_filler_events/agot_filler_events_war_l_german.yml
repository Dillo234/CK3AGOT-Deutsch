 agot_filler_war.100.desc:0 "Our coffers are in a sorry state; such is the price of waging war. Much of this can, of course, be resolved by allowing our soldiers to “Live off the Land”, a pretty euphemism invented to hide the reality of forcefully requisitioning supplies and coin from the peasantry. Thus far, though, we’ve been thoroughly committed to paying soldiers and buying supplies with gold from our reserves. Unfortunately, those reserves have run dry over such a protracted campaign, my Steward has informed me, and as such, continuing the war will require some adjustments to be made…"
 agot_filler_war.100.a:0 "It would seem we must sue for peace"
 agot_filler_war.100.a_tt:0 "Though it pains you to do so"
 agot_filler_war.100.b:0 "Desperate times come for desperate measures. Send for the Iron Bank!"
 agot_filler_war.100.b_tt:0 "An envoy should arrive within a few months, Gods willing"
 agot_filler_war.100.c:0 "Hogwash! Dock their pay, cut their rations. We will win, no matter the cost"
 agot_filler_war.100.c_tt:0 "The soldiers are made of tough stuff, they'll manage"
 agot_filler_war.101.t:0 "The Envoy Arrives"
 agot_filler_war.101.desc:0 "At long last, a representative from the Iron Bank has arrived! We welcomed him as gracious hosts, providing him with what little luxury we can afford at present. We discussed my current financial situation at length that evening, and after some debate about interest rates and exact figures, we managed to agree to a settlement that both parties found acceptable."
 agot_filler_war.101.a:0 "The smallest loan will suffice; the war will be won soon enough"
 agot_filler_war.101.a_tt:0 "The Iron Bank will have its due..."
 agot_filler_war.101.b:0 "A midsized loan will surely see us through to victory"
 agot_filler_war.101.b_tt:0 "The Iron Bank will have its due..."
 agot_filler_war.101.c:0 "Our situation is desperate. No expense can be spared"
 agot_filler_war.101.c_tt:0 "The Iron Bank will have its due..."

 agot_filler_war.200.t:0 "Down the Slopes of Death"
 agot_filler_war.200.desc:0 "War! The battle grows weary on our side... As losses pile up, darkness reigns the crumbling sky, and carnage has begun."
 agot_filler_war.200.list_1:0 "I am the last of my line.. If I should fall, let it be worthy of remembrance, upon my loyal steed and my lance gripped firm in my hand."
 agot_filler_war.200.list_2:0 "I can't hold myself together any longer, I have not a warrior's soul."
 agot_filler_war.200.a:0 "They shall sing songs about my deeds..."
 agot_filler_war.200.a_tt:0 "I venture forth, to meet my doom..."
 agot_filler_war.200.b:0 "Chaos reigns around me... I must live."
 agot_filler_war.200.b_tt:0 "You scurry away..."
 agot_filler_war.201.t:0 "Down the Slopes of Death"
 agot_filler_war.201.desc:0 "Fields of flames greets my eye, as my knights' horns sound the charge.. I smell the fear and pain of dying men in agony, friend and foe. It could drive a man insane. But on the field waits my fate, and may it be foretold from ancient times... in a clear hill it stands, a beast with sharp iron teeth, and hateful burning eyes."
 agot_filler_war.201.a:0 "I know now what is to come. It's no use, to try and run... What is to be.. "
 agot_filler_war.201.a_tt:0 "let it be done. May I draw my final breath, the last of my kin..."
 agot_filler_war.202.t:0 "Down the Slopes of Death"
 agot_filler_war.202.desc:0 "What is to be, let it be done! My opponent lies dead at my feet. As my sight pans over the battlefield, I see the enemy has started to rout in their flank. My actions won the day, and songs will be sung of how the last [GetPlayer.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] led his men in a fearless charge to victory."
 agot_filler_war.202.a:0 "Seek out a bard troupe for me. Let them spread word of my heroics today."
 agot_filler_war.202.a_tt:0 "So it shall be."
 agot_filler_war.202.b:0 "It really is something... to see my men look up to me like this."
 agot_filler_war.202.b_tt:0 "They need me."
 agot_filler_war.203.t:0 "Down the Slopes of Death"
 agot_filler_war.203.desc:0 "The leader of the bard troupe I hired has returned, tales of my deeds are sung from Bear Island to the Stepstones and beyond."
 agot_filler_war.203.a:0 "And may many more of them be written."
 agot_filler_war.203.b:0 "One is enough, I guess."
 agot_filler_war.203.b_tt:0 "Let's not go too far..."

 agot_filler_war.300.t:0 "The Folly of Broken Men"
 agot_filler_war.300.desc:0 "At the wake of the battle's end, some of my men desecrated a nearby village. There's nothing to do for the poor inhabitants - my men were shaken and disturbed by war and cared not for the lives of the peasants. At least they were put to the sword in the end. Saved them from a lifetime of dwelling on past horrors committed upon them by your men."
 agot_filler_war.300.a:0 "Hang those who raped and pillaged - we are all prisoners to war's hell, it does not give us license to act like common bandits."
 agot_filler_war.300.a_tt:0 "Give the peasants justice."
 agot_filler_war.300.b:0 "We can't throw our soldiers' lives away like this, whatever their actions. We're at war. Throw them back in line, discipline them."
 agot_filler_war.300.b_tt:0 "Punishing my men won't help me win the war."
