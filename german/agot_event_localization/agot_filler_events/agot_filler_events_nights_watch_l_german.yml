Easily we find the pack's trail, and after some few days, we corner the wolves in a branch of forest untouched since perhaps the First Men.\n\nYet the farther into the woods we go, the more [goon.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] seems to lose [goon.GetHerHis] nerve, and soon [goon.GetHerHis] whinging becomes skittish and afeard.\n\nThe twilight falls and the torchlights rise, and [goon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] grabs my arm. "I feel their eyes," [goon.GetSheHe] whispers. "We are being hunted." Birds chitter, and in the deep woods around us the lit lamps of unfeeling red eyes stare back, fixating on us as if the woods themselves are weighing if we are predator or prey."

Bushes shake. The birds quiet so softly that a cold silence slithers into each of us, then an aching howl cries out, and in the dark its mate answers.\n\nWolves rush from the woods, fangs and claws and grey fur thrashing around us like a roiling grey sea. Over the yelping of the beasts, [goon.GetTitledFirstName] cries out in pain. [goon.GetSheHe|U] lies on his belly, and above him stands a monstrous, snarling direwolf, its snout bloodied with gore, its yellow eyes as wild as winter.

A direwolf of monstrous size stands in my way as I clear the brush, its hot stink of breath on my face, as it snarls and drools before me.

Where are the wolves?\n\nThen I see the monster that has been haunting the Gift — not the direwolf that every one of my brothers secretly feared, not a wolf at all.\n\nThe bear is massive, its haunches larger and stronger than a charger's, its forepaws the size of bucklers. With a roar like a ship crashing against rocks, the beast charges me. Time freezes and I at last see the wolves circling the perimeter, waiting for the larger beast to end me.\n\nThe bear's jaws stretch wide as it lunges for me,"

Some of my brothers have not returned from the Gift at all, and I feel their loss as a stab in my gut. These wolves, it seems, are no ordinary pack. When at last one of my brothers is calm enough to give a coherent account of what happened, he speaks of a hulking beast with yellow eyes and black fur. They were ambushed, he says, and barely escaped the encounter with their lives.\n\nWhat has the Night's Watch come to? We are charged to protect the realms of men, but we cannot even protect our neighbors from wild animals."
