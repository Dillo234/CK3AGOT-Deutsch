 agot_filler_vale.200.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost"
 agot_filler_vale.200.desc:0 "The Mountains of the Moon are an inhospitable place filled with even more inhospitable people. From time to time, these mountain clansmen must be pushed back into the mountains, should they come raiding the fertile lands of the Vale.\n\nWhile pursuing a clansmen raiding party through a familiar mountain pass with a small entourage, the weather takes a turn for the worse. Before I realize it, I find myself alone — wholly enveloped in a crushing blizzard with no sense of direction."
 agot_filler_vale.200.a:0 "I must press on."
 agot_filler_vale.200.a_tt:0 "These mountains are home to shadowcats, and worse..."
 agot_filler_vale.200.b:0 "Call it off, it's too dangerous!"
 agot_filler_vale.200.b_tt:0 "You and your men return to safety before you get lost."

 agot_filler_vale.201.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost"
 agot_filler_vale.201.desc:0 "I must keep moving; the frost has started to take over my limbs.\n\nLo, what's that ahead? Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the figure of a man approaching through the snow squall?"
 agot_filler_vale.201.a:0 "It must be a mountain clansman."
 agot_filler_vale.201.a_tt:0 "I've no option but to make common cause and survive. Desperate times make for desperate alliances..."
 agot_filler_vale.201.b:0 "It's of no use."
 agot_filler_vale.201.b_tt:0 "I lose the will to struggle..."

 agot_filler_vale.202.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost No More"
 agot_filler_vale.202.desc:0 "My unexpected companion and I make haste through the storm. They clearly know these mountains, and before long, we've arrived at their clan hall.\n\nWe take a seat by a roaring fire; warmth has never felt so good. A hot meal is placed before us, and I happily break bread with this clansman — if only to ensure guest right.\n\nBut as we exchange thanks and discuss our ways of life, I can't help but feel we are more similar than different. Perhaps, even, I could befriend this clan chief and win myself a worthy ally."
 agot_filler_vale.202.a:0 "We ought to spill ale at feasts, not blood in war."
 agot_filler_vale.202.a_tt:0 "I've found common ground with my host, and now I can call them a friend."
 agot_filler_vale.202.b:0 "Me, sharing supper with a savage?"
 agot_filler_vale.202.b_tt:0 "This meal will be our last together. I can't wait to return home..."

 agot_filler_vale.203.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost, A Friend Found"
 agot_filler_vale.203.desc:0 "The storm has finally broken, and the clan chief has invited me to play a local game of their mountain tribe. They even promises a small favor if I win, with a wink."
 agot_filler_vale.203.a:0 "Sounds interesting!"
 agot_filler_vale.203.a_tt:0 "Your friendship with the clansman flourishes."

 agot_filler_vale.204.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost, A Friend Found"
 agot_filler_vale.204.desc:0 "The game begins!\n\nA checkered board is placed between us, scattered with stone pebbles of light and dark grey. We take turns moving these pieces around the board, claiming the other's pieces in a mock battle of wills."
 agot_filler_vale.204.a:0 "You're going to lose, friend!"
 agot_filler_vale.204.a_tt:0 "Some friendly competition never hurts..."

 agot_filler_vale.205.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost, A Friend Found"
 agot_filler_vale.205.desc:0 "After what seems like the blink of an eye — but turned out to be almost an hour — the game is over."
 agot_filler_vale.205.a:0 "Of course, victory is mine."
 agot_filler_vale.205.a_tt:0 "That was very entertaining!"
 agot_filler_vale.205.b:0 "It seems my loss has come with a debt."
 agot_filler_vale.205.b_tt:0 "I'll have to pay them back later..."

 agot_filler_vale.206.t:0 "A Wanderer Lost No More"
 agot_filler_vale.206.desc:0 "It feels bittersweet, to leave my friend after all we've been through.\n\nWe swear an oath of alliance and friendship before we take separate ways at a crossroads, and I return home."
 agot_filler_vale.206.a:0 "That's a story to tell my grandkids, one day."
 agot_filler_vale.206.a_tt:0 "I return home, reinvigorated."

 agot_filler_vale.300.desc:0 "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle], [steward.GetTitledFirstName], brings good news — a caravan from the Riverlands carrying a hefty load of valuable goods is passing along the high road. Surely they wish to sell some treasures in the Vale for a fair price."
 agot_filler_vale.300.a:0 "I can't wait to see their wares!"
 agot_filler_vale.300.a_tt:0 "The high road is perilous this time of year..."
 agot_filler_vale.300.b:0 "I hope they have some nice books!"
 agot_filler_vale.300.b_tt:0 "Surely a new tome will help fill your days."
 agot_filler_vale.300.c:0 "I hope the wine merchant I met a few years ago returns like he promised..."
 agot_filler_vale.300.c_tt:0 "You simply cannot get a proper Arbor red in the Vale."

 agot_filler_vale.301.t:0 "Windswept"
 agot_filler_vale.301.desc:0 "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle], [steward.GetTitledFirstName], brings grave news — the Riverlander caravan was swept by a strong gale of winds while passing the high road. The whole group of merchants plummeted to their deaths below... There were no survivors."
 agot_filler_vale.301.a:0 "Seven hells!"
 agot_filler_vale.301.a_tt:0 "It seems the Stranger has claimed the treasures for himself."
 agot_filler_vale.301.b:0 "The corpses might carry some fine valuables..."
 agot_filler_vale.301.b_tt:0 "You loot the corpses for their valuables."

 agot_filler_vale.400.desc:0 "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle], [steward.GetTitledFirstName], has accompanied me to the docks to take stock of our naval strength when we are approached with a disturbing report: One of my ships, called #italic Sea's Sister#!, has mutinied! The contents of the vessel have been sold to pirates, likely halfway across the Narrow Sea by now, never to be seen again."
 agot_filler_vale.400.a:0 "Disturbing indeed!"
 agot_filler_vale.400.a_tt:0 "Perhaps some investigation will shed light on this mystery."

 agot_filler_vale.401.t:0 "The Sister's Chicanery"
 agot_filler_vale.401.desc:0 "[steward.GetTitledFirstName] has been working tirelessly to find the #italic Sea's Sister#!, asking every merchant vessel in and out of port if it has been sighted.\n\nFinally, the hard work paid off, as a sailor claims to have seen the mutinied ship sailing near the Sisters!"
 agot_filler_vale.401.a:0 "I shall demand answers!"
 agot_filler_vale.401.a_tt:0 "Prepare a ship to sail for the Sisters."
 agot_filler_vale.401.b:0 "We have more important things to focus on."

 agot_filler_vale.402.t:0 "The Sister's Chicanery"
 agot_filler_vale.402.desc:0 "[sister_lord.GetTitledFirstName] denies any involvement in the matter, despite the Sisters' coffers reportedly having swollen much since the ship mutinied."
 agot_filler_vale.402.a:0 "You will come with me in chains."
 agot_filler_vale.402.a_tt:0 "I will not be insulted!"
 agot_filler_vale.402.b:0 "I cannot prove this accusation..."
 agot_filler_vale.402.b_tt:0 "I refuse to become a tyrant. I have to let this slide..."

 agot_filler_vale.500.desc:0 "The harvest of pumpkins by the smallfolk in my lands has yielded exceptionally large gourds this season. One such pumpkin is reported to be as large as a horse-drawn carriage!"
 agot_filler_vale.500.a:0 "This will make me rich!"
 agot_filler_vale.500.a_tt:0 "With proper investment, these massive pumpkins could be extremely profitable."
 agot_filler_vale.500.b:0 "I will twist this on my favor..."
 agot_filler_vale.500.b_tt:0 "The promise of praise and glory for these smallfolk is worth more than gold. I am truly a mastermind!"

 agot_filler_vale.600.desc:0 "An explorer is said to have found a relic while exploring an old Andal ruin — a carving of the seven-pointed star in rock, dating from the time of the coming of the Andals."
 agot_filler_vale.600.a:0 "I shall keep it as a family heirloom."
 agot_filler_vale.600.a_tt:0 "The gods will favor me!"
 agot_filler_vale.600.b:0 "It's no doubt worth some gold..."
 agot_filler_vale.600.b_tt:0 "Some septon will pay good coin for this."
