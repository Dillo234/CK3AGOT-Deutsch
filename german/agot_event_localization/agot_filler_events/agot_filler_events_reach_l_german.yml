#Arson

 agot_filler_reach.100.t:0 "Burning Bushes"
 agot_filler_reach.100.desc:0 "Surveying my demense is serious business, especially when the harvest is imminent. Today, while visiting a nearby farm, my [marshal.GetCouncilTitle] [marshal.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] brings me disturbing news. \n\nThroughout my realm, there have been increasing reports of arson — not targeting farms or fields, but rather... #N flowerbeds!#! \n\nNormally this wouldn't be much of a problem, but in the Reach flowerbeds do take up rather a lot of space."
 agot_filler_reach.100.a:0 "Let us see what we can do, after the fires go down."
 agot_filler_reach.100.a_tt:0 "You will investigate the matter in due time."

 agot_filler_reach.101.t:0 "Burning Bushes"
 agot_filler_reach.101.desc:0 "The fires have died down enough for my men and I to look into the situation. \n\nIt seems the blaze spread quicker than I had imagined it would — entire fields have been scroched to black. #italic What are we going to do about these lands? In this state, they'll be impossible to sow new crops!#!"
 agot_filler_reach.101.a:0 "I will make a sizeable investment to see them workable again."
 agot_filler_reach.101.a_tt:0 "This is surely enough."
 agot_filler_reach.101.b:0 "I know #bold just#! what to do!"
 agot_filler_reach.101.b_tt:0 "All that time spent gardening has finally paid off! If I bring in new soil to mix with the burnt dirt, perhaps it will reinvigorate the land."
 agot_filler_reach.101.c:0 "It may be a good time to leverage my station."
 agot_filler_reach.101.c_tt:0 "By pulling a few favors, you can convince professional land workers to fix this mess for your favor, saving you some gold."
 agot_filler_reach.101.d:0 "We must catch whoever did it!"
 agot_filler_reach.101.d_tt:0 "#bold This needs to stop.#!"

 agot_filler_reach.102.t:0 "Burning Bushes: Land Renewed"
 agot_filler_reach.102.desc:0 "[steward.GetTitledFirstName] brings me exciting news this fine day! "Thanks to your aid, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], the scorched lands are now workable again," [steward.GetSheHe] says.\n\n"Finally, the farmers can return to their fields, and the smallfolk sing your praise!""
 agot_filler_reach.102.a:0 "Now we can begin seeding."
 agot_filler_reach.102.a_tt:0 "Call for men to work the fields again."

 agot_filler_reach.103.desc:0 "[spymaster.GetCouncilTitle] [spymaster.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] enters my bedchamber stealthily, with a concerned look on [spymaster.GetHerHis|l] face. \n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], I apologize for the lateness of my visit. I have heard back from my little birds, but we still have no word of the arsonist's whereabouts," [spymaster.GetSheHe|l] says timidly. "He is most likely in hiding, but he could be #italic anywhere...#!""
 agot_filler_reach.103.a:0 "You useless twat!"
 agot_filler_reach.103.a_tt:0 "You fire your spymaster."
 agot_filler_reach.103.b:0 "How do I know you haven't been involved?"
 agot_filler_reach.103.b_tt:0 "Perhaps some light torture will reveal the truth of it..."

 agot_filler_reach.200.t:0 "That Stings!"
 agot_filler_reach.200.desc:0 "The Reach is truly home to the greatest of gardens, and I am lucky enough to have mine own to wander. \n\nAs I stroll past the flowers and shrubberies, I hear a loud buzzing behind me. A huge bee darts past my face, and I instinctively swat at it. \n\n#N Oh no.#! The maesters always tell you not to swat at bees."
 agot_filler_reach.200.a:0 "NOT THE BEES!"
 agot_filler_reach.200.b:0 "I know some herbs that'll sooth the pain"
 agot_filler_reach.200.c:0 "TEAR UP THE GARDEN AND BURN IT ALL!!!"


# For UShawBruh events
# Order of the Green Hand
 agot_filler_reach.301.t:0 "Order of the Green Hand"
 agot_filler_reach.301.desc:0 "It is said an ancient knightly order was founded by House Gardener, then the Kings of the Reach, that bore a Green Hand on a White Shield. While the last of its members were extinguished during Aegon's Conquest, many still speak of their many chivalric acts before their demise in the Field of Fire. \n\nI find myself lost in thought, dreaming of a return to such heroism. After all, why should I, [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], not restore the strength of the descendents of Garth Greenhand?"
 agot_filler_reach.301.a:0 "I shall join the Order of the Green Hand!"
 agot_filler_reach.301.a_tt:0 "You take vows to uphold chivalry throughout the Reach."
 agot_filler_reach.301.b:0 "On second thought..."

 agot_filler_reach.311.t:0 "Harvest's Yield"
 agot_filler_reach.311.desc:0 "My demense is home to many farms and fields, along with the workers who toil all summer long to bring forth a fine harvest. \n\nMy [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] comes to me with news of the season's turn. "It is time for a great harvest, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]," [steward.GetSheHe|l] proclaims. "If the crops are bountiful, the realm will thrive! But if they are poor...""
 agot_filler_reach.311.a:0 "Time to reap what we've sown!"
 agot_filler_reach.311.a_tt:0 "You only hope that it will be enough."

# Traders Arrive
 agot_filler_reach.312.t:0 "Traders in the Market"
 agot_filler_reach.312.desc:0 "The Reach has many a fine market, and none as grand as mine own. While visiting the local stalls today, I notice a caravan of foreign traders has set up shop. \n\nI overhear chatter from the smallfolk about the many wares the traders have to offer — some which might improve my domains. To think they arrived and set up shop without first seeking me out..."
 agot_filler_reach.312.a:0 "Perhaps we could establish a trade route."
 agot_filler_reach.312.a_tt:0 "Time to put on the charm. Hopefully you can be convincing..."
 agot_filler_reach.312.b:0 "Perhaps we could establish a trade route!"
 agot_filler_reach.312.b_tt:0 "Time to put on the charm. Hopefully you can be convincing!"
 agot_filler_reach.312.c:0 "They must pay a tax to do business here."
 agot_filler_reach.312.c_tt:0 "You take a share of the gold the traders have made."
 agot_filler_reach.312.d:0 "The market is busy today."
 agot_filler_reach.312.d_tt:0 "You take little notice of the traders and continue on your way."

 agot_filler_reach.313.t:0 "Traders in the Market"
 agot_filler_reach.313.desc:0 "My hopes for establishing a trade route with the traders has been a fruitless endevour. Honestly, I am shocked at how they rejected my offer with a laugh."
 agot_filler_reach.313.a:0 "This is emberassing..."
 agot_filler_reach.313.a_tt:0 "Your offer was met with laughter by the traders."
 agot_filler_reach.313.b:0 "I don't think you realize who you are talking to..."
 agot_filler_reach.313.b_tt:0 "The traders need to be reminded of their station in life."

# The Reach Coins
 agot_filler_reach.314.t:0 "Coins of the Old Reach"
 agot_filler_reach.314.desc:0 "Keeping the finances of my realm in check is of the utmost importance to me. Imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon an odd coin while counting my moneys! \n\nBefore Aegon's Conquest, the Reach used its own gold coins, known as hands for the symbol of Garth Greenhand on them. How this one ended up in my possession, I have no idea. But what should I do with it?"
 agot_filler_reach.314.a:0 "An odd coin like this may come in handy."
 agot_filler_reach.314.a_tt:0 "Surely it is worth more than its weight in gold."
 agot_filler_reach.314.b:0 "I ought to sell it for some real coin!"
 agot_filler_reach.314.b_tt:0 "It may not be a gold dragon, but you'll take what you can get."
 
# Maester and the Bettle
 agot_filler_reach.315.t:0 "The Maester and the Beetle"
 agot_filler_reach.315.desc:0 "The Reach is home to as many different types of bugs as we have varieties of crops — and it's not uncommon for them to be of interest to our maesters. A maester has come to my court, obsessed with a type of beetle known only to these parts. \n\nHe has talked about it endlessly since he arrived. I am at my wit's end. I finally decide to put my foot down when he begins to discuss the beetle's metamorphosis from a grub while I am eating my supper!"
 agot_filler_reach.315.a:0 "Perhaps he can bug my Marshal."
 agot_filler_reach.315.b:0 "Perhaps he can bug my Steward."
 agot_filler_reach.315.c:0 "This ends now..."
 
 agot_filler_reach.316.t:0 "The Maester and the Beetle"
 agot_filler_reach.316.desc:0 "The barracks is unusally lively tonight. When I inquire with my [marshal.GetCouncilTitle|l] about it, [marshal.GetSheHe|l] informs me that the visiting maester shared some of his knowledge with the soldiers. \n\n"The men found it interesting, though not in the way the maester had hoped," [marshal.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] tells me with a grin. Apparently this type of beetle fights to win its mate, something the men have turned into a blood sport!"
 agot_filler_reach.316.a:0 "I think I'll put a few coins down."
 agot_filler_reach.316.b:0 "Very well, carry on."
 agot_filler_reach.316.c:0 "*Squish*"
 
 agot_filler_reach.317.t:0 "The Maester and the Beetle"
 agot_filler_reach.317.desc:0 "The two beetles clash, each trying to throw the other off the log that serves as their arena. The men have even named the beetles after legendary jousters, though I doubt such would be considered a flattery. The two in this fight are named the Laughing Storm and the Dragonknight. \n\nEventually, one of the beetles knocks its opponent off-kilter, pushing it off the log to the cheers and groans of the men."
 agot_filler_reach.317.a:0 "Ah! What good fun!"
 agot_filler_reach.317.a_tt:0 "But which beetle did you bet on?"
 
 agot_filler_reach.318.t:0 "The Maester and the Beetle"
 agot_filler_reach.318.desc:0 "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle] and the visiting maester have been spending time with each other in deep talks. Today I found out why, as [steward.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] hands me a colorful piece of cloth. Apparently this type of beetle can be used to create a rather colorful dye! \n\nMy [steward.GetCouncilTitle] believes the dyed cloth can be sold for a decent profit..."
 agot_filler_reach.318.a:0 "Maester! Tell me more about this beetle!"
 
 agot_filler_reach.319.t:0 "The Maester and the Beetle"
 agot_filler_reach.319.desc:0 "The visiting maester dropped all interest in this dammed beetle the moment I mentioned that I would force him to eat a full bowl of them the next time he mentioned a bug in my presence."
 agot_filler_reach.319.a:0 "Finally, some peace!"

# Garden Party 
 agot_filler_reach.320.t:0 "A Garden Party"
 agot_filler_reach.320.desc:0 "I have been informed of a garden party being hosted! The thought of spending time with others in a beautiful garden is very tempting..."
 agot_filler_reach.320.a:0 "I think I will attend!"
 agot_filler_reach.320.a_tt:0 "You go to the party."
 agot_filler_reach.320.b:0 "I have better things to do!"
 agot_filler_reach.320.b_tt:0 "You do not go to the party."
 
 agot_filler_reach.321.t:0 "A Garden Party"
 agot_filler_reach.321.desc:0 "This is exactly how I imagined it! The guests move about in different groups, discussing various things. Two groups catch my eye — one is discussing the varity of plants in the garden and the other is a group of playing drinking games."
 agot_filler_reach.321.a:0 "I will go to the garden."
 agot_filler_reach.321.a_tt:0 "Interesting conversations about plants would be nice!"
 agot_filler_reach.321.b:0 "I will go to the garden."
 agot_filler_reach.321.b_tt:0 "Interesting conversations about plants would be nice!"
 agot_filler_reach.321.c:0 "Pour me a drink!"
 agot_filler_reach.321.c_tt:0 "You join them in their drinking games!"
 
 agot_filler_reach.322.t:0 "Drinking Games: Win"
 agot_filler_reach.322.desc:0 "I best the final opponent at the drinking table, a hedge knight who afterwards strikes up a conversation with me. The knight sings my praise, though I suspect he is hoping to gain work at my court!"
 agot_filler_reach.322.a:0 "I could use a knight like you!"
 agot_filler_reach.322.a_tt:0 "The hedge knight joins your court."
 agot_filler_reach.322.b:0 "Thank you, my good Ser!"
 agot_filler_reach.322.b_tt:0 "You welcome the praise, though you will not give the knight a place at your court."
 
 agot_filler_reach.323.t:0 "Drinking Games: Lose"
 agot_filler_reach.323.desc:0 "I awake later, my clothes soiled in both booze and my own piss. It seems that I had more than I could handle and passed out..."
 agot_filler_reach.323.a:0 "Dear me..."
 agot_filler_reach.323.a_tt:0 "Every lord and lady will hear about this."

 #Wine Merchant
 agot_filler_reach.324.t:0 "The Wine Merchant"
 agot_filler_reach.324.desc:0 "While making my way through the market a wine merchant caught my attention. They offered a rare vintage to me for sale."
 agot_filler_reach.324.a:0 "A good price!"
 agot_filler_reach.324.a_tt:0 "Clearly the wine merchant does not realize what they possess!"
 agot_filler_reach.324.b:0 "Ha! A poor imitation."
 agot_filler_reach.324.b_tt:0 "You can clearly see that this is in fact a poor attempt at making a fake."
 agot_filler_reach.324.c:0 "Why is it so much?"
 agot_filler_reach.324.c_tt:0 "Have your habits become known to the local merchants?"
 
 agot_filler_reach.325.t:0 "The Wine Merchant: A Fake!"
 agot_filler_reach.325.desc:0 "While entertaining some guests, I thought I would make a impression by bring out the vintage wine I had purchased at the market. My hopes at a good impression died away as the sour piss wine touched my lips."
 agot_filler_reach.325.a:0 "I was tricked..."
 agot_filler_reach.325.a_tt:0 "The vintage was clearly a fake."
 agot_filler_reach.325.b:0 "I wish to never drink again..."
 agot_filler_reach.325.b_tt:0 "The vintage was clearly a fake; perhaps I should rethink my life."

 #Woodharp
 agot_filler_reach.326.t:0 "The Woodharp Player"
 agot_filler_reach.326.desc:0 "While resting at a tarven, a beautiful sound fills my ears! A bard is playing a woodharp for the patrons of the tavern."
 agot_filler_reach.326.a:0 "What a beautiful sound!"
 agot_filler_reach.326.a_tt:0 "You relax and enjoy the evening."
 agot_filler_reach.326.b:0 "Perhaps I have a passion for music?"
 agot_filler_reach.326.b_tt:0 "You develop an interest in the musical arts."
 agot_filler_reach.326.c:0 "I will sing along!"
 agot_filler_reach.326.c_tt:0 "You sing along with the woodharp player's melody."
 agot_filler_reach.326.d:0 "I wish to speak to the player."
 agot_filler_reach.326.d_tt:0 "You speak with the busker."
 
 agot_filler_reach.327.t:0 "The Woodharp Player"
 agot_filler_reach.327.desc:0 "After they finish playing, my men inform the woodharp player that I wish to meet them.\n\nThe busker approaches, more shyly than I would expect of someone with such talents."
 agot_filler_reach.327.a:0 "I wish to invite you to my court!"
 agot_filler_reach.327.a_tt:0 "The woodharp player will entertain your court now."
 agot_filler_reach.327.b:0 "Thank #italic you#! for the music!"
 agot_filler_reach.327.b_tt:0 "You give a small donation to the busker."

# Possible farmland
 agot_filler_reach.328.t:0 "The Grass Is Greener"
 agot_filler_reach.328.desc:0 "My realm never ceases to amaze me. While exploring my demense, I stumble upon a gorgeous tract of fertile land. Surely this would make for the greatest of farms!"
 agot_filler_reach.328.a:0 "Perhaps I could build a farm here?"
 agot_filler_reach.328.a_tt:0 "You have the land tended to and developed for farming."
 agot_filler_reach.328.b:0 "Why till the soil myself when I can make some quick coin selling it?"
 agot_filler_reach.328.b_tt:0 "You find a suitable buyer to lease the land."
 agot_filler_reach.328.c:0 "Land this pristine deserves to remain untouched."
 agot_filler_reach.328.c_tt:0 "I will preserve the nartual look of this land."

# Stealing Crops
 agot_filler_reach.329.t:0 "The Stealer of Crops"
 agot_filler_reach.329.desc:0 "A local farmer has brough forth a man he accuses of stealing crops from his field. The thief claims that he did so only to feed himself, as he had nothing to eat and is starving.\n\nSurely a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l] such as myself can find a just solution!"
 agot_filler_reach.329.a:0 "Let the man go."
 agot_filler_reach.329.a_tt:0 "The man is just trying to survive."
 agot_filler_reach.329.b:0 "Let the man go."
 agot_filler_reach.329.b_tt:0 "The man is just trying to surive."
 agot_filler_reach.329.c:0 "The law is clear."
 agot_filler_reach.329.c_tt:0 "The thief will be imprisoned, but at least he will be feed there."
 agot_filler_reach.329.d:0 "A waste of my time! Lock them both up!"
 agot_filler_reach.329.d_tt:0 "Both men will be placed in prison for wasting your time with such a trivial matter."
 agot_filler_reach.329.e:0 "Someone else should deal with this..."
 agot_filler_reach.329.e_tt:0 "I cannot bring myself to make judgment on this..."

# Beekeeping - Zombieschrodcat
# events: 330-339
 agot_filler_reach.330.t:0 "A Swarm of Bees"
 agot_filler_reach.330.desc:0 "While strolling through the garden, I come upon a massive #bold swarm of bees#!! While initally shocked at the sight, a local beekeeper informs me that bees often behave this way while seeking a new hive. During such a state, the worker bees are very docile and form a mass to protect their queen."
 agot_filler_reach.330.a:0 "Perhaps I should try to keep them..."
 agot_filler_reach.330.b:0 "Best to leave them be!"

 agot_filler_reach.331.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.331.desc:0 "With the aid of the local beekeeper, I am able to set up a new hive for the swarm. He explains that though the hive is docile now, once the queen is established, the colony will show its true personality. The thought amuses me... #italic bees with personality!#!"
 agot_filler_reach.331.a:0 "Hopefully this will be a profitable venture."

 agot_filler_reach.332.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.332.desc:0 "Curse that beekeeper for being right! The hive was docile for the first few days, but after that the bees have become increasingly aggressive. Now, I can barely enter the garden without a few giving me chase — and #bold stinging#! me!"
 agot_filler_reach.332.a:0 "I must keep at it..."
 agot_filler_reach.332.b:0 "I want them gone!"

 agot_filler_reach.333.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.333.desc:0 "The aggressiveness of the hive has not let up, but I have become faster at avoiding them! Still, once the hive has produced enough honey to harvest, it will indeed be a profitable venture!"
 agot_filler_reach.333.a:0 "Perhaps this is a good hobby after all."
 
 agot_filler_reach.334.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.334.desc:0 "One morning, I venture out into the garden. When I notice no bees flying about, I rush to inspect the hive. On the ground lay hundreds of my bees... #bold dead!#! \n\nI call for the local beekeeper to help me crack the hive open, in hopes of saving the queen. But alas, when we get it open, I feel the sting of shock. The honey comb is ruined, covered in the larva of what the beekeeper calls #N wax moths#!."
 agot_filler_reach.334.a:0 "The honey is ruined!"

 agot_filler_reach.335.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.335.desc:0 "The hive has changed some, but it still remains very docile. I enjoy spending time in the garden, observing the bees working. \n\nSeldom do they mind me at all, and I have only gotten a few stings since my time keeping my bees."
 agot_filler_reach.335.a:0 "This is quite pleasent!"

 agot_filler_reach.336.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.336.desc:0 "The flowers are in full bloom, and the hive is bursting with energy. As the bees dart from plant to plant, they pay no mind to me. \n\nI find myself outside working the garden more, if only to keep the flowers happy for my bees. When the time comes to harvest the honey, all I see is liquid gold!"
 agot_filler_reach.336.a:0 "I must do this again!"

 agot_filler_reach.337.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.337.desc:0 "Early one morning, a loud crash brings me rushing to the garden, my men following behind me in haste. Luckily for me that my men are armed, because a #bold large bear#! greeted us! \n\nThe scent of honey had drawn the beast to my beehive, and it had broken into the garden in pursuit of it!"
 agot_filler_reach.337.a:0 "We must drive it off, or kill it!"
 agot_filler_reach.337.b:0 "It may attack us, if provoked!"

 agot_filler_reach.338.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.338.desc:0 "My eyes dart around the entrance to the garden. Luck smiles upon me again, as my hunting bow is resting against the wall with some arrows for training with. I quickly grab the bow and notch. \n\nMy arrow flies at the bear, finding its mark in the beast's eye! It roars in pain, rearing to flee the garden — but it just makes it outside before collapsing lifeless. \n\nThankfully the beehive is unharmed, and I am able to make a nice profit from the honey it had produced!"
 agot_filler_reach.338.a:0 "More excitement than I had expected!"

 agot_filler_reach.339.t:0 "A Hive of Mine"
 agot_filler_reach.339.desc:0 "One of my men fires an arrow at the bear, finding its mark in the beast's eye! It roars in pain, rearing to flee the garden — but it just makes it outside before collapsing lifeless. \n\nLuck does not smile upon me a second time, as the damage has already been done — the hive and honey are beyond salvage!"
 agot_filler_reach.339.a:0 "A most unfortunate event..."

 agot_filler_reach.340.desc:0 "While in the market, I come upon a vendor who claims to be selling seeds from a far-off land."
 agot_filler_reach.340.a:0 "I'll buy them."
 agot_filler_reach.340.b:0 "Clearly a scam!"

 agot_filler_reach.341.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Nothing"
 agot_filler_reach.341.desc:0 "Some time passes after planting the seeds, and nothing has grown in that spot. Either the seeds were bad or I have been swindled..."
 agot_filler_reach.341.a:0 "A waste of gold."

 agot_filler_reach.342.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Growth"
 agot_filler_reach.342.desc:0 "One morning when I venture out to the garden, I see that the seeds have indeed sprouted. Hopefully they grow well in the Reach's rich soil!"
 agot_filler_reach.342.a:0 "I wonder what it'll be?"

 agot_filler_reach.343.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Buds"
 agot_filler_reach.343.desc:0 "As the plant grows in size, I start to notice small buds appearing on the plant. My maester tells me this indicates that the mystery plant may soon flower!"
 agot_filler_reach.343.a:0 "The garden will be alive with color!"

 agot_filler_reach.344.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Flowers"
 agot_filler_reach.344.desc:0 "The buds have finally bloomed! What a sight the garden has become — the flowers add such vibrant colors to it! Such beauty they have brought that I've been giving tours to guests when they visit!"
 agot_filler_reach.344.a:0 "My garden will be the talk of court!"

 agot_filler_reach.345.t:0 "Strange Seeds: The Smell"
 agot_filler_reach.345.desc:0 "The buds have finally bloomed! Though the flowers are beautiful, they produce a smell that has made the garden inhospitable. Few can stand to be near the flowers long without growing sick. My courtiers have describled it as a smell similar to rotting flesh."
 agot_filler_reach.345.a:0 "This smell is not doing favors to my reputation..."

 agot_filler_reach.346.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Rapid Growth"
 agot_filler_reach.346.desc:0 "The vines of the plant seem to be spreading everywhere — and #italic very#! quickly. Though the plant is healthy and flowering, my gardeners are worried it could choke out the nearby plants."
 agot_filler_reach.346.a:0 "It seems to be thriving here!"

 agot_filler_reach.347.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Melons"
 agot_filler_reach.347.desc:0 "My gardeners have done well to keep the ever-growing vines contained, and they have noticed strange melons growing on the vines. Upon harvesting them, a brave servant offered to give one a taste. \n\nLuckily, the melons are very sweet and #bold not#! toxic. My gardeners keep debating where the seeds may have originated from. Some think perhaps the Vale, while others suspect Essos or perhaps even the Summer Islands."
 agot_filler_reach.347.a:0 "I bet they will sell nicely!"
 agot_filler_reach.347.b:0 "I'll send them to local Lords."
 agot_filler_reach.347.c:0 "I'll donate them to the Faith."

 agot_filler_reach.348.t:0 "Strange Seeds: Vines Everywhere"

Soon offshoots of the plants have been found elsewhere in the garden. My gardeners fear the only solution might be to burn the garden — in order to save it."

 agot_filler_reach.349.desc:0 "While riding near the woods, I come across a maester conducting an odd experiment upon some wild fruit trees. When I ask what he is doing, he explains that he is "grafting" different trees together. \n\nApparently, by splicing the branch from one tree onto the branch of another similar one, a single tree can be made to produce fruit of both varieties."
 agot_filler_reach.349.a:0 "An orchard of different fruits on one tree!"
 agot_filler_reach.349.b:0 "Can it be done with flowering trees?"
 agot_filler_reach.349.c:0 "This is my land, you will leave now!"

 agot_filler_reach.350.t:0 "Grafting Trees: Flowering Trees"
 agot_filler_reach.350.desc:0 "I followed what the maester had told me that day about grafting trees, taking time to splice together various flowering trees onto a sturdy host. \n\nNow that those trees have bloomed, the host tree is vibrant with myriad colors! Each branch that I grafted onto the tree has produced a different flower!"
 agot_filler_reach.350.a:0 "A beautiful sight to behold!"

 agot_filler_reach.351.t:0 "Grafting Trees: Fruit Trees"
 agot_filler_reach.351.desc:0 "I followed what the maester had told me that day about grafting trees, taking time to splice together various fruit trees onto a sturdy host. \n\nNow that those trees have produced fruit, the host tree is alive with apricots, dates, peaches, and plums! Each branch that I had grafted onto the tree has produces its original fruit!"
 agot_filler_reach.351.a:0 "A very profitable discovery!"

 agot_filler_reach.352.t:0 "Grafting Trees: Blight!"
 agot_filler_reach.352.desc:0 "The orchard is ruined! It seems one of the branches I had used for the grafting experiment was blighted, and now all of the trees with grafted branches have started to die!"
 agot_filler_reach.352.a:0 "The orchard is ruined!"

 # agot_filler_reach.401.desc:0 "You are walking through the gardens of PLACEHOLDER at night, and you hear a rumbling in the bushes. You draw your dagger to investigate this disturbance but as your eyes grow more used to the dark you see it is PLACEHOLDER and PLACEHOLDER. PLACEHOLDER spots you and stops immediately. They both fall to their knees and beg you to keep their secret."
 # agot_filler_reach.401.a:0 "Wanton lechers! The world will know of your disgrace!"
 # agot_filler_reach.401.b:0 "My amorous friends. I'll keep your secret… for a price..."
 # agot_filler_reach.401.c:0 "The Mother teaches virtue but also mercy. You have my silence. "

 # agot_filler_reach.501.t:0 "A Duel to the Death"
 # agot_filler_reach.501.desc:0 "You are out riding one morning and see two figures fighting in a clearing. At first, it seems they are merely sparring but as you draw closer it appears far more ferocious than you had first thought, one of the men thrashing the other, who is unable to stand. Furthermore, you recognise the man who appears to be brutalising the other. It is PLACEHOLDER. As you venture even closer, it appears the man on the ground is a Dornishman!"
 # agot_filler_reach.501.a:0 "My friend, PLACEHOLDER, let's show this Dornishman what we do to the likes of him!"
 # agot_filler_reach.501.b:0 "Enough PLACEHOLDER! You'll kill the poor man! Stop this at once or you'll have me to deal with!"
 # agot_filler_reach.501.c:0 "This is clearly none of my concern, a private matter for the two of them to settle."
