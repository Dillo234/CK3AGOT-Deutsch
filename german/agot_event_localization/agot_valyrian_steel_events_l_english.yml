agot_valyrian_steel.2000.t:0 "Lamenting the Lost"
agot_valyrian_steel.2000.desc:0 "While walking the streets of [location.GetName] my mind wanders to the horrific events which took place here during the Dance of the Dragons, and both the great valor and shame of Ser [ancestor.GetFullName]. Slain during the Ride of the Seven, charging to the defense of the doomed Prince Joffery. He is the great honor of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName], and the subject of inumerable songs — yet his loss was also that of the ancestral Valyrian steel sword Lamentation.\n\nIt has not been seen for many years, but I know in my heart there must be a trail to unearth. One I can follow to the glory of reclaiming what once was ours. Afer the valiant fall of Ser Willam, there are conflicting sightings of what happened next, but most center on a single point..."
agot_valyrian_steel.2000.a:0 "The Dragonpit..."
agot_valyrian_steel.2000.a.tt:0 "You will investigate the disappearance of Lamentation..."
agot_valyrian_steel.2000.b:0 "That monstrous time is better left forgotten."

agot_valyrian_steel.2001.t:0 "The Lament of the Dragons"
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.desc:0 "I descend into the delapidated ruins of the Dragonpit, and the solemn atmosphere of what occurred here is palpable. A miasma of death, of ash and fear lingers, crystallized in the final dying moment of the great lizards and the thousands crushed beneath the crumbling monument which became a tomb.\n\nAs I wander I begin to realize the breadth of the project that lays before me. A reclamation scheme to unearth the bones of men and women and beasts who died in screaming terror. It will be difficult and arduous, and may produce nothing at all. But at the chance at finding the ruby amongst the stone, it could be priceless."
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.a:0 "Searching these ruins will be costly..."
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.a.tt:0 "You will hire men to clear rubble."
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.b:0 "Perhaps the Grand Maester can assist my search?"
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.b.tt:0 "Maester [maester.GetFullName] might hold something in [maester.GetHerHis] archives."
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.c:0 "Perhaps the smallfolk will have a trail to follow."
agot_valyrian_steel.2001.d:0 "To run to the past is folloy. I will forge my own future."

agot_valyrian_steel.2002.t:0 "Nothing!"
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.desc:0 "Despite our immense efforts, we have yet to discover anything in regards to the wherabouts of Lamentation, or what occured that night in this pit. I am beginning to feel this is a hopeless endeavour."
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.a:0 "It HAS to be here, I can feel it!"
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.a.tt:0 "More men, more spades, keep digging!"
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.b:0 "Perhaps the maester was the correct choice."
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.c:0 "A riot of peasants, let us investigate peasants."
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.c.tt:0 "You will ask around Flea Bottom."
agot_valyrian_steel.2002.d:0 "This is a foolish dream."

agot_valyrian_steel.2003.t:0 "Rediscoverd!"
agot_valyrian_steel.2003.desc:0 "Finally, after years of turmoil, Lamentation has been unearthed and returned to the cherishing hands of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName]. We value our history, for we are among the most venerable houses in the Kingdoms, and now I hold in my hands the physical proof of the legitimacy of our steeped history. "
agot_valyrian_steel.2003.a:0 "We Remember!"


agot_valyrian_steel.2004.t:0 "Lost to Time."
agot_valyrian_steel.2004.desc:0 "It seems Lamentation is destined to remain lost for now..."
agot_valyrian_steel.2004.a:0 "Perhaps it is not mine to be had..."
agot_valyrian_steel.2004.a.tt:0 "You were unsuccessful in your endeavor."

agot_valyrian_steel.2005.t:0 "Knowledge!"
agot_valyrian_steel.2005.desc:0 "The great Maester Verkos theorised that the dragon might have eaten your sword and then pooped it out idk seems nuts but you can go check it out. Dragon bodies were traditionally brought to Dragonstone."
agot_valyrian_steel.2005.a:0 "Time to peep that dragon dung."
agot_valyrian_steel.2005.a.tt:0 "You will charter a ship to Dragonstone."
agot_valyrian_steel.2005.b:0 "This is fucking bonkers, I'll ask around Flea Bottom."

agot_valyrian_steel.2006.desc:0 "[host.GetFullName] graciously welcomes me to Dragonstone in my search for my missing sword. Tells me that dragon corpses and likewise have been return to dragonstone to the dragonmont for many years to be disposed of in the flames. However it is dangerous up there."
agot_valyrian_steel.2006.a:0 "We venture out tomorrow!"
agot_valyrian_steel.2006.a.tt:0 "You will charter a ship to Dragonstone."
agot_valyrian_steel.2006.b:0 "This is fucking bonkers, I'll ask around Flea Bottom."

agot_valyrian_steel.2007.a:0 "We push through the Gorge."
agot_valyrian_steel.2007.a.success:0 "You navigate the ridge."
agot_valyrian_steel.2007.a.fail:0 "You slip on unstable gravel."
agot_valyrian_steel.2007.b:0 "We must turn back!"

agot_valyrian_steel.2008.t:0 "Into the Gorge"
agot_valyrian_steel.2008.desc:0 "Looking around now let's see"
