 agot_scenario_rr_ha_initialization_decision_desc:0 "The reign of my father, King Aerys II, has become a nightmare for the lords and ladies of Westeros — and for all the people of the Seven Kingdoms. His unpredictable outbursts, fueled by paranoia and his obsession with fire, are a liability for the realm and my house. His tyranny has brought House Targaryen to the very edge of our demise, and it must be stopped..."
 agot_scenario_rr_ha_initialization_decision_tooltip:0 "You will send ravens to the important houses of the realm that remain loyal to the crown and ask them to commence for a war council."

 agot_scenario_rr_false_banner_decision:0 "Under False Banner"
 agot_scenario_rr_false_banner_decision_desc:0 "While King Aerys II wages war against the rebelling Lord Robert Baratheon, I have stayed neutral. My old friend Aerys no doubt suspects I will support him, marching my army to his aid — especially as he holds my golden son Jaime hostage as his sworn shield. But alas, the Mad King has thrown the Seven Kingdoms into disarray, leaving himself nothing but the Red Keep as redoubt. If I were to march on King's Landing under a flag of support, I could easily sack the city and end the rule of a madman."
 agot_scenario_rr_false_banner_decision_tooltip:0 "There is great peril involved in such a feint, but you may put your cunning to the test for the sake of the realm — or for the sake of #bold your legacy#!."
 agot_scenario_rr_false_banner_decision_confirm:0 "Begin preparations!"
