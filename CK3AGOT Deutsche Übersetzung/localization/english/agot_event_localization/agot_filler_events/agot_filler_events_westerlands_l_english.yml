# LION IN A CAVE EVENT #
########################

 agot_filler_westerlands.0001.t:0 "A Lion's Roar" 
 agot_filler_westerlands.0001.desc:0 "The rocky crags and rugged hills of the Westerlands are home to all manner of fierce creatures, but none as vicious as the cornered lion.\n\nWhile surveying a craggier stretch of my domain, I have discovered a series of caverns carving their way through the heart of a mountain. The more of the caves I explore, the more I seem to find untouched.\n\nAs I contemplate the next dark opening before me, the quiet of the morning is shattered by a fearsome roar. Immediately, I know the cave ahead is home to a #N lion#!!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0001.a:0 "A lion? Of course, I must face it."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0001.a_tt:0 "You unsheathe your blade and prepare to go in for the kill."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0001.b:0 "On second thought, I ought to head back to the keep."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0002.t:0 "A Lion's Roar"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0002.desc:0 "My sword is drawn, my grip tight. I know I will only get one or two clean strikes upon the beast before its sharp claws reach me.\n\n"This is my moment for glory," I tell myself. Taking a deep breath, I rush into the cave."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0002.a:0 "Songs will be written about me!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0002.a_tt:0 "But what will they say?"

 agot_filler_westerlands.0003.t:0 "A Lion's Roar"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0003.desc:0 "The lion's claws were indeed sharp — but not long enough to reach me. My rush into the cave startled the poor beast, and I was able to hack and slash at the lion freely before it could maul me.\n\nUnfortunately, its pelt is matted in blood; it would have made a great trophy."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0003.a:0 "At least they might write that song!"

#   The Old Man's Gem  #
########################

 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.t:0 "The Old Man's Gemstone"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.desc:0 "I oft pass my spare time by wandering in the woods, giving myself a chance to clear my head of the worries of ruling. But on today's walk, I come across an old man. Usually, I'd pay the commoners no mind—but this one seems eager to have my attention...\n\nThe old man introduces himself as [old_man_filler1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], and claims his forebears were not always commoners. "We were once lords not unlike yourself," he rasps with a toothy grin. "But how we lost our seat is a song for another day..."\n\nHe draws forth a peculiar gemstone from his pocket. It glimmers in red and gold hues. "My ancestors were rich, even for the Westerlands. This gem is one of the last remaining vestiges of our once mighty rule. I see it has caught your fancy," his grin hardens into a scowl. "I would part with this gem, but the price would be steep...""
 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.a:0 "Well, this seems quite the rare find!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.a_tt:0 "But what if it's a fake..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.b:0 "I am a noble. I take what I want!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.b_tt:0 "You take the gem by force."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0004.c:0 "No, thank you. This intrusion has only added to my worries."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0005.t:0 "The Old Man's Gemstone"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0005.desc:0 "I find myself stressfully fidgeting with the red-and-gold gemstone. Was it worth the cost I paid for it? Could it indeed be the last remnant of an extinguished house?\n\nMy [steward.GetCouncilTitle], [steward.GetTitledFirstName], notices my worried demeanor and offers counsel. "Entrust the gem to me, and I can assess the authenticity of its origins," [steward.GetSheHe] says. I hardly have a chance to answer before the gemstone is in [steward.GetHerHis] hands..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0005.a:0 "I pray this puts my mind at ease."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0005.a_tt:0 "But do you truly trust your steward?"

 agot_filler_westerlands.0006.t:0 "The Old Man's Gemstone"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0006.desc:0 "It has been a week since anyone in the keep has seen my [steward.GetCouncilTitle], none knowing the task with which I'd entrusted [steward.GetHerHim]. I find myself pacing back and forth in my throne room, increasingly agitated.\n\nAfter all I went through to secure the gemstone, I am now certain: #N My [steward.GetCouncilTitle] has stolen the red-and-gold gem for [steward.GetHerHis] own!#!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0006.a:0 "That swine!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0006.a_tt:0 "Perhaps you ought to find a new steward..."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0007.t:0 "The Old Man's Gemstone"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0007.desc:0 "[steward.GetTitledFirstName] enters the throne room, trembling — in fear or anger, I cannot tell. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I apologize for my appearance, but I have... upsetting news," [steward.GetSheHe] stammers.\n\n"Speak plainly," I urge. Then, with a sigh, [steward.GetSheHe] brings forth the red-and-gold gemstone from [steward.GetHerHis] pocket. By [steward.GetHerHis] look, I can tell the search to verify its authenticity has concluded.\n\n"A fake, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," [steward.GetSheHe] says, handing the #italic 'gem'#! back to me."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0007.a:0 "Damn you!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0007.a_tt:0 "You feel a lion's rage take over your body as you lunge for your steward."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0007.b:0 "Damn that thief!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0007.b_tt:0 "How did you fall for such a ruse?"

 # FireFighter451: As scripted, I believe this is just a death outcome rather than a duel.
 agot_filler_westerlands.0008.t:0 "The Old Man's Gemstone"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0008.desc:0 "I leap toward my steward, allowing my anger to burst forth even though he is just the messenger.\n\nUnfortunately for me, my steward reaches for his sword in defence, and I am a bit slow to react..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0008.a:0 "Gods be good, what have I done?"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0008.a_tt:0 "So much blood..."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0009.t:0 "The Old Man's Gemstone"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0009.desc:0 "[steward.GetTitledFirstName] enters the throne room, trembling — in fear or excitement, I cannot tell. "My lord, I apologize for my appearance, but I have... #bold wonderful#! news," he says, breathing heavily. He clearly came in a hurry.\n\n"Speak plainly," I urge. With a gasp, he brings forth the red-and-gold gemstone from his pocket. By his look, I can tell his search to verify its authenticity has concluded.\n\n"This gem is impeccable, my lord," he says, handing it to me. "I was able to verify that it is, in fact, a treasure of the extinguished House Reyne!""
 agot_filler_westerlands.0009.a:0 "A rare find indeed!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0009.a_tt:0 "But does that mean... The old man I met..."

#   Rock Slide   #
##################

 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.t:0 "A Rock Slide"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.desc:0 "The Westerlands have no shortage of perils, especially among the rugged hills and craggy mountains.\n\nWhile surveying a rocky expanse of my domain with [steward.GetTitledFirstName], a messenger approaches us in a hurry. "What is it?" my [steward.GetCouncilTitle] intercedes.\n\n"Apologies, I don't mean to interrupt, but we have word from a local village that a massive rock slide has wiped out part of a crucial trade route in and out of town," the messenger explains. "The townsfolk call to their liege for assistance in this difficult time.""
 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.a:0 "These things do happen..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.a_tt:0 "You're sure these townsfolk can solve the problem for themselves."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.b:0 "My men can sort this out."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.c:0 "The townsfolk call for me, you say?"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0010.c_tt:0 "You will go yourself — and make it known how diligently you rule."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0011.t:0 "Upset Local Townsfolk"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0011.desc:0 "The end of another long day draws near. As my councilors and I are wrapping up a conversation, an unruly din floods into my usually calm throne room.\n\nA petitioner steps forward angrily. "My liege, you neglected us in our time of need! Because of the rock slide damaging our main trade route, mothers and babes have starved. Their blood is on your hands," he utters before my guards drag him out of the court along with his companions."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0011.a:0 "What was I supposed to do?"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0011.a_tt:0 "It seems you'll need to send your men to clean this up after all..."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0012.t:0 "Fallen Rocks Removed"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0012.desc:0 "My [marshal.GetCouncilTitle] [marshal.GetTitledFirstName] enters the throne room with a proud look on his face. "My liege, I have word back from the men you sent to clean up the damage done by that rock slide," [marshal.GetSheHe] explains cheerily. "The road is cleared, and the townsfolk send their praise. The men are en route back to the castle as we speak.""
 agot_filler_westerlands.0012.a:0 "Thank the gods!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0012.a_tt:0 "Now the townsfolks will sing your praises."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0012.b:0 "My men deserve a hero's welcome!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0012.b_tt:0 "And you've got plenty of spiced honey wine from Lannisport to go 'round."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.t:0 "Time to Move Some Rocks"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.desc:0 "I have arrived at the scene of the rock slide, and it is as bad as the messenger described. Large boulders are strewn about like a child's toys. The road itself is nearly impassable.\n\nIt's time for me to take this into my own hands."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.a:0 "I'll lead a group of my men to sweep the area."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.b:0 "I'll bring in my carts and horses."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.b_tt:0 "But send a messenger to the townsfolk to bring as many able-bodied men to help out..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.c:0 "Give me just a moment to think of a solution."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.c_tt:0 "Perhaps you can remove the rocks more expediently using the mechanics of our siege weapons to lift them..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.d:0 "I know just how to smooth this over!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.d_tt:0 "With some quick sketches and some detailed planning, you'll have these boulders removed in no time."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.e:0 "Uhhh, where am I? *Drools*"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0013.f:0 "Why am I exhausted already?"

 agot_filler_westerlands.0014.t:0 "Fallen Rocks Removed"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0014.desc:0 "At last, the damage caused by the rock slide has been repaired. All those who assisted with clearing out the boulders can breathe a sigh of relief, and trade has officially resumed."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0014.a:0 "And I can finally rest."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0015.t:0 "Fallen Rocks Removed"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0015.desc:0 "In short order, the damage caused by the rock slide has been repaired. Trade has officially resumed, and the commoners sing my praises."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0015.a:0 "It feels good to be resourceful!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0015.a_tt:0 "A mind needs puzzles to solve like a sword needs a whetstone."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0016.t:0 "Fallen Rocks Removed"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0016.desc:0 "In short order, the damage caused by the rock slide has been repaired. In fact, thanks to my detailed planning, the trade routes have been improved mightily.\n\nThe townsfolk are amazed that my idea worked so flawlessly, and travel along the path has never been safer."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0016.a:0 "Sometimes I amaze myself!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0016.a_tt:0 "A mind needs puzzles to solve like a sword needs a whetstone."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0017.t:0 "Road Damages Worsened"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0017.desc:0 "It seems the more I have attempted to clear out the boulders, the worse the road beneath the rocks has been damaged. I am beginning to think the road will never be cleared. Is it possible for me to sneak away and never speak of this again?"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0017.a:0 "Drats!"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0017.a_tt:0 "You may have overestimated your abilities..."

 agot_filler_westerlands.0018.t:0 "Attempting to Remove the Rocks"
 agot_filler_westerlands.0018.desc:0 "I'm determined to move a large boulder that has fully blocked the road along a cliff's edge, but the more I heave the shorter my breath becomes..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0018.a:0 "I'm feeling faint..."
 agot_filler_westerlands.0018.a_tt:0 "But how close to the cliff's edge are you standing?"
