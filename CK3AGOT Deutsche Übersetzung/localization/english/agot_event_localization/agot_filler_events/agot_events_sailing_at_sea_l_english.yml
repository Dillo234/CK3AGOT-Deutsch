Even amidst the tempest's din, I can make out his desperate cries of terror as the ghastly abyss threatens to drag him down to a watery grave."

In the first few weeks, my diet hadn’t been much different than it had been at home; as supplies dwindled, though, I was soon eating the same as my men. For a while yet, we still had our stores of salt beef and cured pork. Those days are long gone. My men and I have now been condemned to a diet of hardtack and rusk. \n\nThe tiredness and the aches started first, though it was easy enough to ignore. But, the aches got worse, and now whenever I stand, it feels as though the hells themselves are burning in my knees. The worst came this morning as I sat down to eat my hardtack; as I bit into it, one of my teeth came dislodged from my swollen, bloody gums…"

Burned and broken wooden planks, scattered crates, barrels and chests, all floating on the surface of the ocean; along with the sight of a golden chest... \n\nIt's clear that something terrible has happened here.

You can't resist the desire to follow the voice, and as you draw closer, the moonlight shines down upon the calm sea around you. You realize that your ship is no longer in view.
