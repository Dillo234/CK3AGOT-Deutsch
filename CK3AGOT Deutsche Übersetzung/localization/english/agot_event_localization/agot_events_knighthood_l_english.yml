 # Hedge knight wants to squire your heir
 agot_knighthood.0016.t:0 "The Hedge Knight"
 agot_knighthood.0016.desc:0 "A hedge knight has been sleeping in my halls for the past few nights. It seems my son, [potential_child_squire.GetName], has taken a liking to him. Likewise, the hedge knight has become fond of my son as well. My son became enamored with the hedge knight after hearing him recount his thrilling tales of knighthood and chivalry.\n\nOn [hedge_knight.GetHerHis] last day in my court, the hedge knight offers to stay in my court and let my son be his squire.\n\nThe man seems honorable enough, and it would make my son very, very happy. I have to think about this."
 agot_knighthood.0016.a:0 "Yes, you must stay and take him as a squire!"
 agot_knighthood.0016.a.tt:0 "[hedge_knight.GetName] will join your court and take your son as [hedge_knight.GetHerHis] [squire|e]."
 agot_knighthood.0016.b:0 "No, I don't think you're the right knight."
 agot_knighthood.0016.b.tt:0 "[hedge_knight.GetName] will leave your court."

 # Hedge knight wants to knight your non-heir son
 agot_knighthood.0700.t:0 "The Hedgeknight and the Spare"
 agot_knighthood.0700.desc:0 "A hedge knight by the name of [hedge_knight.GetName], has recently visited my court. A [hedge_knight.GetCulture.GetName] by birth, he has travelled across the realm to seek the service of a lord. I know little of this man, save for the fact that he allegedly comes from minor Westerland noble stock, and is, of course, a knight.\n\nI have not paid any attention to him, and as such, I expected him to be moving on soon. However, he came to me, in confidence, and offered to knight my son, [potential_child_knight.GetName], in exchange for being allowed to stay for as long as he pleases!"
 agot_knighthood.0700.a:0 "I suppose such an arrangement can be made."
 agot_knighthood.0700.b:0 "No, I will not agree to it."

 agot_knighthood.0701.t:0 "The Hedgeknight and the Lord"
 agot_knighthood.0701.desc:0 "A hedge knight by the name of [hedge_knight.GetName], has recently visited my court. A [hedge_knight.GetCulture.GetName] by birth, he is travelling across the realm for reasons unknown.\n\nWhile I have not paid an attenton to him, it seems he has paid attention to me. A crudely written note offering me knighthood, signed by none other than [hedge_knight.GetFirstNamePossessive], was delivered to one of my servants early this morning. For the right price, the note claims, I can be made a knight."
 agot_knighthood.0701.a:0 "I will accept this deal."
 agot_knighthood.0701.b:0 "No, I will not agree to it."
