 agot_bm_8157:0 "The Conquest of Dorne"
 agot_bm_8157_desc:0 "When Prince Daeron the Young Dragon ascended the Iron Throne in 157 AL, he declared war on the independent Kingdom of Dorne to complete the legacy of his ancestor Aegon the Conqueror and unite all Seven Kingdoms under Targaryen rule. Daeron won the war quickly, a victory that he immortalized in his book Conquest of Dorne: 'The arms of House Martell display the sun and spear, the Dornishman's two favorite weapons, but of the two, the sun is the more deadly.' After the invasion, the Young Dragon left the Lord Paramount of the Reach to rule Dorne in his stead. The proud Dornishmen, although defeated, would neither submit to a Dragon nor a Tyrell. Conspiracies and revolts spread throughout Dorne like wildfire, culminating in the death of Lord Tyrell. His death led to rebellion throughout Dorne and in a fortnight all Daeron had achieved was undone."
