 #Rhaegar Targaryen
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.1.desc:0 "The love that sparked between Lyanna Stark and I burned deep in both our hearts from our first meeting. My Queen of Love and Beauty, with her crown of winter roses, blue as frost. Our love has angered many, her betrothed, Robert Baratheon, most of all. His ire casts a shadow most black over the Kingdoms, but he could not stop us from making haste to Dorne and eloping beyond the judgemental eyes of our families. My love is safe in the Tower of Joy, and there is no army strong enough to wrench us apart. Our destiny has been foretold; ours is the song of Ice and Fire…"
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.1.a:0 "The Dragon does not break so easily."
 #Aerys II Targaryen
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.2.desc:0 "Traitors! Traitors one and all! Who is Jon Arryn to deny my right to justice, to break the King’s peace? The Starks, so insolently demanding my son’s life, simply for him protecting the wolf girl from that lecherous lordling of Storm’s End! The Tullys, too, who owe all that they own to my house, now rise in open rebellion against their King! All the while, the ingrate, Tywin Lannister, hides beneath Casterly Rock, the Others take him! They will pay! #bold They will pay with Fire and Blood! #"
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.2.a:0 "#bold Burn them! Burn them all! #"
 #Mace Tyrell
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.3.desc:0 "Robert Baratheon and his followers have risen up against our rightful liege, King Aerys. The Targaryens are the rightful Lords of the Seven Kingdoms, and we Tyrells owe them for our place in the realm. We did not arrive at where we are by making rash decisions, we did so through carefully choosing our battles and fulfilling our duty. We will now defend the crown against the rebels, as would be the duty of any loyal vassal."
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.3.a:0 "And by doing so, we will grow ever stronger."
 #Doran Martell
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.4.desc:0 "King Aerys is our ally by blood through my sister Elia's marriage to the Crown Prince Rhaegar. Lord Robert Baratheon has risen up against the tyranny of the cruel king following the execution of Eddard Stark's brother and father, as well as Prince Rhaegar's kidnapping of Lyanna Stark. His cause may well be just, but with my nephews under the direct care of the king in the capitol we have little choice but to march in support of the crown."
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.4.a:0 "The Lords of Dorne shall march."
 #Robert Baratheon
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.5.desc:0 "My beloved Lyanna has been kidnapped by the vile Prince Rhaegar. After protesting this cruel act to King Aerys, Rickard Stark has been cruelly burned alive whilst his son Brandon looked on. Now Eddard Stark and I, with our allies, stand against the Mad King's tyranny. We may not yet know who should succeed the king, but one thing is certain: the reign of the dragon is over!"
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.5.a:0 "The Targaryens will fall by my hands..."
 #Eddard Stark
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.6.desc:0 "My sister is in the hands of Prince Rhaegar, and the mad King Aerys has burned my father alive whilst Brandon, my eldest brother, looked on in despair. Lyanna's betrothed, Robert Baratheon, has risen up against the king's tyranny and I will do my utmost to aid my friend in bringing justice."
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.6.a:0 "Lyanna will be safe again..."
 #Jon Arryn
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.7.desc:0 "My former wards, Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, have risen up against the tyranny of King Aerys. The Mad King burned Rickard Stark and allowed Lyanna Stark, Robert's betrothed, to be kidnapped. I will not let my companions stand alone. The knights of the Vale stand ready, and House Arryn will aid in bringing justice to the realm."
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.7.a:0 "We will prevail"
 #Hoster Tully
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.8.desc:0 "King Aerys, in another fit of madness, has cruelly executed Rickard and Brandon Stark. Prince Rhaegar has also kidnapped Lyanna Stark. We are allied to the Starks by blood, my daughter Catelyn being wed to Lord Eddard. It is clear that the Mad King's reign has outlived its welcome, and order must be returned to the realm at any cost."
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.8.a:0 "The River Lords stand ready"
 #Tywin Lannister
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.9.desc:0 "My old friend King Aerys has provoked Eddard Stark, Robert Baratheon, and their allies into rebellion through his rash actions. The King has repeatedly slighted me despite my loyal service as Hand of the King. If he thinks he will find an eager ally in the Westerlands, he is gravely mistaken. For now sit, wait, and observe."
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.9.a:0 "The lion sleeps... for now..."
 #Quellon Greyjoy
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.10.desc:0 "War has come to Westeros once again. My sons, caught up in their ceaseless drive for glory and plunder, have tried to convince me to take up the sword. But I am an old man, an ailing man. I have won my glory in battles now decades past. I am weary of war, of bloodshed, and I fear my strides in making my people cease their ways of pillage and conquest would be undone the minute a single longship were to depart from our craggy shores. We will not be paying the iron price; not for now, at least…"
 agot_events_scenario_rr_exp.10.a:0 "Not for now, at least..."
