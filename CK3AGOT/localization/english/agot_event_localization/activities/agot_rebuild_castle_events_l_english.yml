Some of my men believe the charcoal gatherers are weary of our presence due to the land being ungoverned for years — and they fear we'll demand taxes.\n\nStill others have pointed out the fact the Night's Watch is comprised of many men sent here as punishment for their crimes, and perhaps they ought to be afraid of us. Reguardless of the reasons, I must act..."

He leads me to a small room that at first I thought to have once been a prison, but then I see the piles of bones.\n\nSome bones still had the chains around them, and on others you could see where they had been broken and rehealed, some several times over. "Wildlings they had prisioner perhaps? ...are these cut marks?" I ask more to myself than the lad, as I looked at the markings on one of the bones. "I had a dog... he loved bones... they would look like that, once he had chewed on it some...
