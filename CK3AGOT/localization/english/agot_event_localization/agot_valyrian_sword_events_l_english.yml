 agot_valyrian_swords.0001.desc:0 "The morning's light stretches across the room, all the way to where Dawn sits on her stone pedestal. The pale blade is concealed by the cool grey scabard, but the golden sun on her pommel gleams in the brightness. This is where Dawn belongs when there is no Sword of the Morning, where she rests in between bouts of fame and glory. \n\nThe granting of Dawn to a Dayne worthy of bearing her is an ancient responsibility, which now falls to me. \nOver the last few years, it has come to my attention that [my_relation.GetFirstName] has grown into a talented knight — but are they worthy of becoming the next \n#S Sword of the Morning? #!"
 agot_valyrian_swords.0001.a:0 "I will bestow Dawn upon [my_relation.GetHerHim]."
 agot_valyrian_swords.0001.b:0 "No, I do not find [my_relation.GetHerHim] worthy."
 agot_valyrian_swords.0002.t:0 "The Sword of the Morning"
 agot_valyrian_swords.0002.desc:0 "The letter is from [my_relation.GetFullNameRegnal]. I turn it over in my hands, and break the purple button of wax sealing it closed.\n\nIt seems that [my_relation.GetFirstName] would name me to be the next #SSword of the Morning#!, if I would accept the honor. So many great Daynes have borne that fabled blade, and brought glory to our House, am I worthy to follow in their footsteps?"
 agot_valyrian_swords.0002.a:0 "I will accept the calling."
 agot_valyrian_swords.0002.b:0 "I am no Sword of the Morning."
 agot_valyrian_swords.0004.t:0 "The Sword of the Mourning"
 agot_valyrian_swords.0004.desc:0 "With the death of [dead_relative.GetFirstName], the mantle of Sword of the Morning stands empty. Once the funeral rites are over and [dead_relative.GetHerHim] is resting with our ancestors, Dawn will return to her pedestal, to await a new bearer. \n\nHowever, perhaps there is already one amongst us who is deserving of that honor... [my_relative.GetFirstName] has demonstrated exceptional talent thus far. Perhaps they would consider taking on the role."
 agot_valyrian_swords.0004.a:0 "I will bestow Dawn on [my_relation.GetHerHim]."
 agot_valyrian_swords.0004.b:0 "No, I do not find [my_relation.GetHerHim] worthy."
