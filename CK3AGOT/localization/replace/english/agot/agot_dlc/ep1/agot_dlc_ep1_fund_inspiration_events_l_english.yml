# ## Postcards from your Adventurer by Isabella Welch

# #Steppe

#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6001.t:0 "The Dothraki Sea and saddle gallop through my heart,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6001.desc:1 "I have been riding for months on end. My rear shall never recover! I've acquired quite the taste for fermented mare's milk and nights beneath the open sky.\n\nWith this courier, I send a gift from the khalasar — a decorative horse head to be placed atop instruments. Perhaps you have a use for it."
#  fund_inspiration.6001.a:0 "I'll hold onto this!"
#  fund_inspiration.6001.b:0 "Send it to the Court Musician."

# #India

#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6002.t:0 "My jaunt along the Rhoyne moves onward,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6002.desc:0 "I am near-blinded by all the gems the courts I visit have to show me. I find myself yearning for the filth of the open river.\n\nI have sent a courier with a particularly tasteless gift I was given — a tiger's head ornament on a ring, with jewels for eyes. Have you ever seen something so garish?"
#  fund_inspiration.6002.a:0 "I rather like it, it's his loss."
#  fund_inspiration.6002.b:0 "Ghastly! Take it apart and sell the gems."

# #Africa

#  fund_inspiration.6003.t:0 "I dream of the Daughters,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6003.desc:0 "My liege, my journey to the Disputed Lands is underway, and I have joined a company traversing the width of the land.\n\nI send to you a piece of jewelry one of my fellow travelers granted me — a most delicate necklace covered in ostrich shell beads. I suppose you haven't seen an ostrich."
#  fund_inspiration.6003.a:0 "A fine find! I will wear it myself."
#  fund_inspiration.6003.b:1 "I shall give it to [event_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."

# #Middle East

#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6004.t:0 "Ah, the old Empire of Ghis,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6004.desc:0 "My journey through Slaver's Bay has mostly involved fighting off hoards of peddlers on the streets.\n\nOft, in order not to delay my quest over-long, I give in and buy one of their little trinkets. I have sent a courier bearing the tat your way. Perhaps it shall provide some amusement."
#  fund_inspiration.6004.a:0 "What use is an adventurer who takes the common path?"
#  fund_inspiration.6004.b:0 "These are some pretty baubles..."

# #Europe

#  fund_inspiration.6005.t:0 "My adventures are sodden,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6005.desc:0 "My Lord, I have found a few trite relics so far in my adventures, which I have sent with this courier, but I am unsure what I may uncover next.\n\nThe Free Cities are home to the smelliest creatures I have encountered. As a child, I dreamt of the green and pleasant meadows, but I am convinced half of this world is made of mud. If you are a gracious liege, please send word to call me back."
#  fund_inspiration.6005.a:0 "This isn't a holiday! Quest on!"
#  fund_inspiration.6005.b:0 "Poor soul, I suppose these rewards shall suffice."
#  fund_inspiration.6005.b.tt:0 "You permit [inspiration_owner.GetTitledFirstName] to return home"

# #Asia minor

#  fund_inspiration.6006.t:0 "Greetings from the Jade Sea,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6006.desc:0 "My travels to the far edge of the known world have left me with quite a taste for lamb, yogurt and eggplants, and I have sent some recipes along with this courier.\n\nI have been given a golden brooch adorned with a seahorse by one of my hosts, which I also send to you. I'm certain my travels will bring further wonders in due time."
#  fund_inspiration.6006.a:0 "Order our chefs to prepare these dishes at once!"
#  fund_inspiration.6006.b:0 "[inspiration_owner.GetSheHe|U] seems to be having too much fun on this quest..."

#  fund_inspiration.6503.t:0 "$fund_inspiration.title$ Pontic Whispers"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6503.desc:0 "\n\n'I have delved into an ancient burial mound, perhaps from the Dawn Age. Hundreds of long-perished horses, stuffed, preserved, and staked to the walls to stand upright, each with their own room. It was a stable for the damned, lost to time.\n\n'Knowing of my duty to seek knowledge for our realm, I considered stealing a relic from the tomb when my guide was not watching to bring to you."
#  fund_inspiration.6503.a:0 "You pocketed one of the ornaments."
#  fund_inspiration.6503.b:0 "You brought one of the horses' saddles, for our study."
#  fund_inspiration.6503.c:0 "You didn't dare disturb the dead."
