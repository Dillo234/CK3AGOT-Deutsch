 #MaA Descriptions
 arbor_marines_flavor:0 "Accustomed to fighting aboard ships of the Redwyne fleet, these lightly armored regiments are adept skirmishers."
 barrow_knights_flavor:0 "Though less splendidly armored than their southern counterparts, heavy cavalry from the Barrowlands can make quick work of all but the most disciplined formations."
 marsh_walker_flavor:0 "The Andal Invasion’s failure to conquer Crackclaw point was due not just to the difficult terrain, but also to the lightly armed warriors who exploited it. These regiments carry on that legacy of hit and run tactics to great effect."
 trackers_flavor:0 "Hailing from the marshlands of the Neck, these lightly armed Crannogmen are as elusive as they are nettlesome to slower infantry."
 royal_crossbowmen_flavor:0 "Crossbows require less training than traditional bows, but can punch through the finest armor with ease, thus neutralizing the advantage of heavy infantry and cavalry."
 finger_scouts_flavor:0 "Although their charge is less devastating than more heavily armored knights, the speed of Fingermen cavalry makes them invaluable for screening slower formations and chasing down routing enemies."
 cape_watch_flavor:0 "Cape Kraken has long been a battleground between ironborn and northmen, and its warriors draw from the martial traditions of both factions."
 green_hand_flavor:0 "The last remnant of an ancient order founded by a King of the Reach, these northern knights bring southron chivalry and tactics to devastating effect against infantry formations."
 dragonkeepers_flavor:0 "The Dragonkeepers once were the guards of the dragonpit, armed with their swords and spears, they now defend the Targaryens, even though the dragonpit has been destroyed."
 honeywine_quirrels_flavor:0 "Crossbowmen from the Reach are well suited to countering the plate armor of knights and heavy infantry, though they are costlier to equip than simple bowmen."
 reavers_flavor:0 "The scourge of the Westerosi coastline, these fearsome heavy infantry represent a serious threat to more lightly armed footmen."
 longbowmen_flavor:0 "Carrying on a proud tradition of the Dornish Marches, these fighters wield powerful longbows to disrupt slow-moving infantry formations."
 hunters_of_the_moon_flavor:0 "Requiring little costly equipment, these archers from the Mountains of the Moon are an efficient counter to lightly armored infantry."
 stolen_spears_flavor:0 "Though more primitively equipped than lowlander soldiers, spearmen of the Mountain Clans delight in skewering the horses of their hated Andal foes."
 clan_champions_flavor:0 "A quarrelsome people by nature, the mountain clans of the North are capable of fielding formidable regiments of seasoned fighters."
 winter_wolves_flavor:0 "In a land of deep snow that persists for years, heavy infantry rather than cavalry often carries the day, but these Northern warriors are at home on any battlefield."
 greenblood_oars_flavor:0 "Having scratched out a meager living aboard rafts on the Greenblood, these warriors nevertheless bear proud memories of their ancient Rhoynish ancestors."
 summer_knights_flavor:0 "The chivalry of the Reach is a beautiful sight to behold in times of peace and a terrifying foe for infantry in times of war."
 river_bows_flavor:0 "The archers of the Riverlands are a light and agile force, able to react to changing conditions on the battlefield and punish enemy infantry formations for any misstep."
 sun_spears_flavor:0 "The unbending spears of Dorne represent a stubborn and dangerous foe to cavalry of all stripes: light, heavy, and even war elephants. "
 sand_steeds_flavor:0 "Famed for their beauty and elegance, the sand steeds of Dorne are among the fastest horses in the world, but their endurance is no less impressive. In battle, Dornish light cavalry is unmatched for its ability to outflank and pursue slower foes."
 misty_shields_flavor:0 "Hailing from the Shield Islands, these regiments are battle-tested against the most fearsome ironborn reavers and must be ready to respond to raids at a moment’s notice."
 sistermen_pirates_flavor:0 "Considered all but ungovernable by their Arryn overlands, the pirates of the Three Sisters are an agile and vexsome force on the battlefield."
 unicorn_riders_flavor:0 "Thought by many to be more legend than fact, the unicorns of Skagos are sure-footed beasts and every bit as rugged as the men who ride them. On the battlefield, they are a fearsome sight to behold."
 pass_pikes_flavor:0 "Descendents of Dornishmen who held the mountain passes against Targaryen invasions for over a century, these warriors stand proud against all forms of cavalry."
 storm_knights_flavor:0 "Like the thunder for which their homeland is named, knights of the Stormlands shake earth and man alike when they come to a charge."
 winged_knights_flavor:0 "The birthplace of Andal culture within Westeros, the Vale is home to a proud knightly tradition that traces its roots back millennia. The Knights of the Vale are all but unstoppable to infantry formations."
 bloody_balesters_flavor:0 "Considered a dishonorable weapon by some, the men of the Westerlands have no qualms about employing crossbows on the battlefield or otherwise."
 sea_snakes_flavor:0 "Hailing from the islands of Blackwater Bay and accustomed to the chaos of naval boarding actions, the quickness and aggression of these regiments serve them well in both pursuit and retreat."
 wolfswood_hunters_flavor:0 "The vastness of the Wolfswood harbors not just wild animals, but also men who make a living hunting them. On the battlefield, such men make crafty archers."
 bronze_raiders_flavor:0 "Hailing from the rugged tundra of the Thenn valley, the Rronze Raiders are some of the few Wildling soldiers that make use of native-made metal weapons. Alongside their impressive armaments, the Bronze Raiders are fearsome in battle; the only heavy infantry found North of the Wall."
