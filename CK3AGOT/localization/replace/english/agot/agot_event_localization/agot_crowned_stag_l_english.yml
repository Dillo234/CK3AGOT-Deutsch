 agot_crowned_stag.0001.desc:0 "After a bloody struggle and the loss of my beloved Lyanna, we have prevailed against the tyranny of the Mad King. The last Targaryens and their treacherous ilk are banished across the Narrow Sea. I now stand as Westeros' rightful king.\n\nAll hail Robert, the First of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm!"

 agot_crowned_stag.0002.desc:0 "It is a hard task being king. Meeting with petitioners, sitting idle for hours in council meetings, hearing the same prattling voices tell me about issues of little to no consequence. Sheep tract rights here, shipping lanes with Myr there. There's no glory in it, no excitement. My blood never rises like it used to - by the #italic Gods#! how it used to thunder when I hefted my hammer. How much I yearn to feel alive again.\n\nSince there's no battle to be had anymore, perhaps I should explore the other, more sensual avenue of release. I hear the Street of Silk offers exactly that..."
 agot_crowned_stag.0002.a:0 "By the #bold Gods#!, I need a woman!"
 agot_crowned_stag.0002.b:0 "I will not stoop so low."

Before long, one approaches you and offers a kind smile."\n\n"Welcome, my lord," she says. "I am [prostitute_character.GetFirstName]. How can I be of service?"\n\nWithin an hour she's gotten you drunk, the light buzz in your belly making the steps towards the stairs easy enough to do without much thinking. This is exactly what you had in mind. It isn't #italic quite#! like a battle, but it'll do. It'll do for now... "
 agot_crowned_stag.0003.a:0 "Finally, some relief..."
