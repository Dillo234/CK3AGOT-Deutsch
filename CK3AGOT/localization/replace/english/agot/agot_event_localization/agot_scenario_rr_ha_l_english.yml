 agot_scenario_rr_ha.0011.desc:0 "The ravens were sent, and now I stand before a room full of my father's vassals, contemplating the dire situation I am in. To depose a king — not just a king, but my father... It seems unimaginable.\n\nAnd yet, before me are those who might just be loyal enough to join my cause. It's now or never: #bold Do I propose that we remove King Aerys II from the Iron Throne?#!"

"My fine councillors, I called you hear under false pretense, a feint I hope can be forgiven," he begins. I shift nervously in my seat.\n\n"The true reason of our gathering is this: My father, King Aerys II of House Targaryen, has gone mad — obsessed with fire, fueled by paranoia. He has led our once great house to a precipice, on the very edge of demise." #italic A gasp cuts through the still air like a blade.#!\n\nRhaegar is proposing treason of the highest degree... #bold To depose the Mad King!#!"
 agot_scenario_rr_ha.0012.a:0 "The dragon prince is right; I will join his plot."

 agot_scenario_rr_ha.0020.desc:0 "The time has come, the plot has been discussed, and now I stand before my councillors awaiting their reply.\n\nMy eyes dart back and forth around the room. Many loyal vassals sit before me. "Who will join me to put an end to the reign of my father, the Mad King?"\n\nMy question lands like a scorpion bolt, taking all the air from the room. But soon, those around me begin to speak up. Soon, a chorus of support rings out — and yet some among us remain silent..."

 agot_scenario_rr_ha.0031.t:0 "The Harrenhal Aftermath"
 agot_scenario_rr_ha.0031.desc:0 "Today, the entire realm weeps: The Mad King, Aerys II, has avoided my scheme to capture him and end his reign swiftly.\n\nDid a raven from one of my councillors reach him? Or did the Spider's little birds see to it themselves? I may never know the truth of it.\n\nAll I know is that the Seven Kingdoms cannot continue under the tyranny of my father. But now, deposing the Mad King becomes even more difficult."
 agot_scenario_rr_ha.0031.a:0 "War it is..."
