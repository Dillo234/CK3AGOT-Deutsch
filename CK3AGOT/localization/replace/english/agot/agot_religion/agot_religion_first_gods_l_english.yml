 bronze_gods_adj:0 "Bronze Gods"
 bronze_gods_adherent:0 "Worshipper of the Bronze Gods"
 bronze_gods_adherent_plural:0 "Worshippers of the Bronze Gods"
 bronze_gods_desc:0 "In times when iron and steel were not known of, bronze was the dominating metal for all purposes. Weapons, tools, and Gods. The people of this faith revere the High God of Bronze, and his two daughters of Tin and Copper. It is said that they once revealed themselves, and told a man how to create the alloy; urging, if not demanding, that he spread the word amongst his fellow mortals. It was conveyed by men of the clergy that creating bronze would bolster the God and his daughters' powers, hence gaining favour with them. This led to a sweeping conquest of neighbouring lands for the search for more resources they may turn into their holy metal."
